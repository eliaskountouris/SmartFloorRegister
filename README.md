# Smart Floor Register (Vent)

Developed alongside 2 mechanical engineering students. The MEs were responsible for designing the housing while I worked on the controller board. This was a prototype design and as such extra connectors and sensors were added they may not be used in the final version.

The controller board interfaces with 4 different thermocouples, which connect to Op-Amps to magnify the signal.

It also drives 2 motor controls (using I2C) and a servo (using PWM).

Power is driven by either batteries or a usb for debugging. A boost converter is on board to power the motors and servos.
